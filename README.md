# REST PHP SYNC
# This is a simple script that allows you to take two sets and automatically sync them together. 
# The items in the sets must have the same name to work. 
# The primary purpose of this script is to import a document, change the document and impoart it again to another set. After running the script, you can compare the two different versions of the document using the sync compare in Jama.
